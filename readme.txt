Pinterest Opt-in by BestBlogTech.com adds a Pinterest follow opt-in your WordPress website.

== Description ==
This plugin adds a Pinterest follow opt-in to your Wordpress site.

Simply add your Pinterest account ID in the plugin's settings to activate it for your website. It is jQuery-based and loads by fading in once a user scrolls more than 30% down the page. Likewise, it fades back out when the user scrolls to the 30% mark back up the page.

This Pinterest Follow Opt-in works for both desktop and mobile devices. Mobile display and the "by BestBlogTech.com" link are optional and can be changed in the plugin's settings.

== Installation ==
Installation is very straightforward:

1. Upload the zip-file and unzip it in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the `Pinterest Opt-in` menu to load the admin settings page.
